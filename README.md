#100daysofMLcode

Day 1: I spent time trying to get a basic understanding of Linear Regression. It is a supervised ML algorithm where an output is related to a single input or multiple inputs in a linear fashion.

For starters, assume that there is only one input and one output (case of Simple Linear Regression). The relation will be determined by the following equation:

y = b0 + b1*x

where
b0 -> bias/y intercept when x = 0
b1 -> slope/coefficient
x -> input
y -> output

The terms are explained briefly in the attached excel sheet. The sample code is present in the attached Jupyter notebook.
